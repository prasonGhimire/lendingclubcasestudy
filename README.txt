LENDING CLUB CASE STUDY
---------------------------------------
This is about analyzing the data from the lending club business to identify some of the key attribute which might 
help the lender to decide on whether its risky to release the loan to the borrower or not.


Some Assumption  made are:

1. lender will only give the amount as much as requested by the borrower.
2. employement of the member is strictly categorized between 1-10 years and -1 indicates the non availability of the information
3. Analysis is made based on the loan tenure of 36 and 60 months only.
4. credit score is assumed to be equal for all the member(this assumption might be misleading).
5. borrowers has provided correct information on their own.


Reccomendation after analysis:
1. When the purpose mentioned is as  "new business“ see detail on the type of business going to be started and its operation and feasibility before lending the sum
2. When the borrowers has their house not owned in their name do better analysis before lending "mortgage" or "rented"
3. Look out for loan grade "B/C/D“, risky to invest.
4. When employed for more years doesnot mean borrower has the cash backup to repay for eg: emp_length  10+  years.
5. risk of defaulting increases with the tenure  of money lended.
6. lower revolving balance can increase the chances of defaulting
